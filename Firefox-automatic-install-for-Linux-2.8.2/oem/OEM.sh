# This OEM file (oem.sh) is redundant. You do not absolutely need to use this file. 
# The enclosed setup files (for example, firefox_nightly.sh) within the OEM folder (directory) can work 
# independently alongside (with) their associated icon file (for example, fn64-icon.sh).  
# However, to use this file anyways, uncomment what you need and save.

# Firefox
# chmod +x ./firefox_stable.sh ; bash ./firefox_stable.sh ;
# Firefox Beta
