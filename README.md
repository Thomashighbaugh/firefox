# Firefox Customizations

[placeholder for screenshots]

## Introduction

I only use Firefox because it lets me customize the interface (for now) with user stylesheets. In order to make this a consistent experience across systems and after reinstallations, I have this repository set up to house those configurations.

## Prerequisites

This is intended for use on Linux, it is untested on both Mac and Windows. I don't have a mac and while I can test it on Windows, I don't use Windows outside of repairing them, so I welcome contributors who use those systems to make pull requests but am unlikely to adjust these files for either.
