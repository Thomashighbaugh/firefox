Hello Linux user.

Looking to install Mozilla Firefox?

Mozilla Firefox comes standard in 64-bit. This particular folder includes the base files for installing Mozilla Firefox 64-bit releases. 
However, to properly install or uninstall Mozilla Firefox, go to the root folder and run the following command:

chmod +x Setup.sh

This will make the script executable (allowing it to run). Next, execute the script by typing one of the following.

   ./Setup.sh

-- OR --

   bash Setup.sh

You will be prompt to select which edition of Firefox you wish to set up. You will also be prompt to enter your password (SUDO) to continue.
You can install or uninstall any edition you wish, including multiple editions side by side. Simply follow the easy menu prompts.

  
-- Happy Browsing!
