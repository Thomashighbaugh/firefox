Hello 32-bit Linux user.

Using an older computer? 
Still on an older 32-bit OS (operating system)?
Have a love of 32-bit applications?
No problem. 

This particular folder includes the base files for installing Mozilla Firefox 32-bit releases. 
However, to properly install or uninstall Mozilla Firefox, go to the root folder and run the following command:

chmod +x Setup.sh

This will make the script executable (allowing it to run). Next, execute the script by typing one of the following.

   ./Setup.sh

-- OR --

   bash Setup.sh

You will be prompt to select which edition of Firefox you wish to set up. You will also be prompt to enter your password (SUDO) to continue.
You can install or uninstall any edition you wish, including multiple editions side by side. Simply follow the easy menu prompts.
