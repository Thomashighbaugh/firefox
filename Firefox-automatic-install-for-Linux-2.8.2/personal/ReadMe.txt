Not the system administrator, and not looking to install Mozilla Firefox for everyone, 
but still want your own copy of Mozilla Firefox? No problem! The personal installer 
is meant for people who wish to have their own little corner of Mozilla Firefox all to themselves.

chmod +x  YOUR_choice.sh (for example, nightly.sh)
bash YOUR_choice.sh

As always, happy browsing!

NOTE: SUSE Linux users will need BZIP2 installed for the script to extract the archive download from Mozilla.
