Requirements:

# You will need to have access to SUDO. = For installation
# You will also need WGET installed. = For the original Firefox download
# Depending on your distro, you will also need TAR or UNTAR, or BZIP2 installed. = To decompress .tar.bz2 file

All of which are usually pre-installed and configured in all 
major mainstream Linux distros.

Run the following command:

chmod +x Setup.sh

This will make the script executable (allowing it to run).  
Next, execute the script by typing one of the following.

   ./Setup.sh

-- OR --

   bash Setup.sh

You will be prompt to select which edition of Firefox you wish to setup.
You will also be prompt to enter your password (SUDO) to continue.
You can install or uninstall any edition you wish, including multiple 
editions side by side. Simply follow the easy menu prompts.


Congratulations, you have successfully setup your copy of Mozilla Firefox!

Linux is best (because it really is).

Want to learn more?

All the script files can be opened with a basic text editor.
There you can review the code and learn how they work.
For basic text editors, I recommend either "nano" via the terminal 
or via your desktop, "xed" or "gedit".

As always, happy browsing! :-)
