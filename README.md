# Firefox Configuration
This is the configuration of my Firefox installations, backed up using the power of Git!

These configurations are typically pulled in as part of the system provision that is performed using the Makefile in my [Dotfiles Repository](https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/dotfiles). Which locates them in a file called `~/.firefox-config` because for some unknown reason, firefox profiles are stored with a dynamic name that is a random and hideous string of characters. Thus it is then necessary to run a provisioning of these profiles from this repo, preventing my set up from being fully automated (but still its better than pretending Basilisk is good enough and being without any of the convenience of modern Firefox).
